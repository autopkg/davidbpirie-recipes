Description: |
  For use with DataJAR's AdobeAdminConsolePackagesImporter.py.

  Using the information gathered by AdobeAdminConsolePackagesImporter.py,
  updates your the override with data.

  Intended use is to generate an override from this recipe, then
  give the override an unique Identifier and populate all the
  Input variables. As per AdobeAdminConsolePackagesImporter.py
  documentation, your override prefix has to match a name within the
  application names table (see https://github.com/autopkg/dataJAR-recipes/blob/master/Adobe%20Admin%20Console%20Packages/AdobeAutoPkgApplicationData.json).

  This recipe is useful if you just want to gather the info, but not
  do anything with it other than store it in your override. You can
  then copy the updated data to pkg or jamf-upload recipes and run
  them directly, instead of utilising AdobeAdminConsolePackagesImporter.py's
  recipe-running feature.

  Your override should not be run directly, but rather will be
  updated and executed by AdobeAdminConsolePackagesImporter.py e.g.:
  sudo ./AdobeAdminConsolePackagesImporter.py pkg /path/to/downloaded-packages-dir

Identifier: com.github.davidbpirie.pkg.AdobeAdminConsole
MinimumVersion: 2.3.0

Input:
  NAME: AdobeAdminConsole
