  SMB_URL, SMB_USERNAME and SMB_PASSWORD, are expected to be populated
  in your AutoPkg preferences, override Input variables, or by
  command-line keys.

  Template files for JAMF_GROUP_TEMPLATE and JAMF_POLICY_TEMPLATE need

  can be shared across multiple recipe overrides.

  JAMF_POLICY_ICON must also either be in your recipe search path or
  provide a full path. It is recommended to store it in your
  RecipeOverrides directory.
