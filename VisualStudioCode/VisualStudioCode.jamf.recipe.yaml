Description: |
  Downloads the latest version of VS Code and makes a pkg of it, then
  uploads the package to Jamf Pro, creating the Category if required,
  and then creates a Self Service Policy and Smart Group.

  JSS_URL, API_USERNAME, and API_PASSWORD, and for non-cloud instances
  SMB_URL, SMB_USERNAME and SMB_PASSWORD, are expected to be populated
  in your AutoPkg preferences, override Input variables, or by
  command-line keys.

  Template files for JAMF_GROUP_TEMPLATE and JAMF_POLICY_TEMPLATE need
  to either be found in your recipe search path or provide a full path.
  Examples are available from
  https://github.com/autopkg/davidbpirie-recipes/tree/main/JamfTemplates
  or https://github.com/autopkg/grahampugh-recipes/tree/main/Jamf_Recipes.
  It is recommended to store them in your RecipeOverrides directory and
  can be shared across multiple recipe overrides.

  JAMF_POLICY_ICON must also either be in your recipe search path or
  provide a full path. It is recommended to store it in your
  RecipeOverrides directory.
